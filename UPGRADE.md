# From 1.3 to 1.4
* The service `brille24_tierprice_tierprice_factory' is *NOT* the example factory anymore. A new service `brille24_tierprice_tierprice_example_factory` has been added for this and the old service `TierPriceFactory` has been re-added to avoid BC breaks.

# From 1.0 to 1.1
The class `TierPriceFactory` was moved to `TierPriceExampleFactory`.
